 * MAIN APPLICATION ENTRY POINT
 *
 * This is the central file that sets up and starts the Bug Tracking System backend.
 * It configures Express.js, connects to the database, sets up middleware, and mounts all API routes.
 *
 * Architecture: Layered Architecture (Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories)
 * - Routes: Define API endpoints and HTTP methods
 * - Controllers: Handle HTTP requests/responses and input validation
 * - Services: Contain business logic and orchestrate data operations
 * - Repositories: Handle direct database interactions
